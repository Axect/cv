      "body": "\n\n\n \n\nRust numeric library contains linear algebra, numerical analysis, statistics and machine learning tools with R, MATLAB, Python like macros.\nWhy Peroxide?\n1. Customize features\nPeroxide provides various features.\n\ndefault - Pure Rust (No dependencies of architecture - Perfect cross compilation)\nO3 - BLAS &amp; LAPACK (Perfect performance but little bit hard to set-up - Strongly recommend to look Peroxide with BLAS)\nplot - With matplotlib of python, we can draw any plots.\nnc - To handle netcdf file format with DataFrame\ncsv - To handle csv file format with Matrix or DataFrame\nparquet - To handle parquet file format with DataFrame\nserde - serialization with Serde.\n\nIf you want to do high performance computation and more linear algebra, then choose O3 feature.\nIf you don't want to depend C/C++ or Fortran libraries, then choose default feature.\nIf you want to draw plot with some great templates, then choose plot feature.\nYou can choose any features simultaneously.\n2. Easy to optimize\nPeroxide uses 1D data structure to describe matrix. So, it's too easy to integrate BLAS.\nIt means peroxide guarantees perfect performance for linear algebraic computations.\n3. Friendly syntax\nRust is so strange for Numpy, MATLAB, R users. Thus, it's harder to learn the more rusty libraries.\nWith peroxide, you can do heavy computations with R, Numpy, MATLAB like syntax.\nFor example,\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate peroxide;\nuse peroxide::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    // MATLAB like matrix constructor\n    let a = ml_matrix(&quot;1 2;3 4&quot;);\n\n    // R like matrix constructor (default)\n    let b = matrix(c!(1,2,3,4), 2, 2, Row);\n\n    // Or use zeros\n    let mut z = zeros(2, 2);\n    z[(0,0)] = 1.0;\n    z[(0,1)] = 2.0;\n    z[(1,0)] = 3.0;\n    z[(1,1)] = 4.0;\n    \n    // Simple but effective operations\n    let c = a * b; // Matrix multiplication (BLAS integrated)\n\n    // Easy to pretty print\n    c.print();\n    //       c[0] c[1]\n    // r[0]     1    3\n    // r[1]     2    4\n\n    // Easy to do linear algebra\n    c.det().print();\n    c.inv().print();\n\n    // and etc.\n}\n\n4. Can choose two different coding styles.\nIn peroxide, there are two different options.\n\nprelude: To simple use.\nfuga: To choose numerical algorithms explicitly.\n\nFor examples, let's see norm.\nIn prelude, use norm is simple: a.norm(). But it only uses L2 norm for Vec&lt;f64&gt;. (For Matrix, Frobenius norm.)\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate peroxide;\nuse peroxide::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let a = c!(1, 2, 3);\n    let l2 = a.norm();      // L2 is default vector norm\n    \n    assert_eq!(l2, 14f64.sqrt());\n}\n\nIn fuga, use various norms. But you should write longer than prelude.\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate peroxide;\nuse peroxide::fuga::*;\n   \nfn main() {\n    let a = c!(1, 2, 3);\n    let l1 = a.norm(Norm::L1);\n    let l2 = a.norm(Norm::L2);\n    let l_inf = a.norm(Norm::LInf);\n    assert_eq!(l1, 6f64);\n    assert_eq!(l2, 14f64.sqrt());\n    assert_eq!(l_inf, 3f64);\n}\n\n5.

Compatible with Mathematics\nAfter 0.23.0, peroxide is compatible with mathematical structures.\nMatrix, Vec&lt;f64&gt;, f64 are considered as inner product vector spaces.\nAnd Matrix, Vec&lt;f64&gt; are linear operators - Vec&lt;f64&gt; to Vec&lt;f64&gt; and Vec&lt;f64&gt; to f64.\nFor future, peroxide will include more &amp; more mathematical concepts. (But still practical.)\n7. Written in Rust\nRust &amp; Cargo are awesome for scientific computations. \nYou can use any external packages easily with Cargo, not make.\nAnd default runtime performance of Rust is also great. If you use many iterations for computations,\nthen Rust become great choice.\nLatest README version\nCorresponding to 0.32.0\nPre-requisite\n\nFor O3 feature - Need OpenBLAS\nFor plot feature - Need matplotlib of python\nFor nc feature - Need netcdf\n\nInstall\n\nRun below commands in your project directory\n\n\nDefaultcargo add peroxide\n\n\nOpenBLAScargo add peroxide --features O3\n\n\nPlotcargo add peroxide --features plot\n\n\nNetCDF dependency for DataFramecargo add peroxide --features nc\n\n\nCSV dependency for DataFramecargo add peroxide --features csv\n\n\nParquet dependency for DataFramecargo add peroxide --features parquet\n\n\nAll featurescargo add peroxide --features &quot;O3 plot nc csv parquet&quot;\n\n\n\nUseful tips for features\n\nIf you want to use QR or SVD or Cholesky Decomposition then should use O3 feature (there are no implementations for these decompositions in default)\nIf you want to write your numerical results, then use parquet or nc features (corresponding to parquet or netcdf format. (It is much more effective than csv and json.)\nTo plot, use parquet or nc feature to export data as parquet or netcdf format and use python to draw plot.\n\nplot feature has limited plot abilities.\nTo read parquet file in python, use pandas &amp; pyarrow libraries.\nThere is a template of python code for netcdf. - Socialst\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\nExample\nPeroxide Gallery\nVersion Info\nTo see RELEASES.md\n"

The proposed method attempts to tackle shortcomings in existing learning-based assessment approaches, such as the requirement of manual annotation for motion influence and the lack of explicit mechanisms for realizing motion-induced abnormalities under contextual variations in CVS over time. By utilizing long-short term memory and variational auto-encoder structures, an encoder--decoder model is trained not only to self-reproduce an input sequence of the CVS but also to extrapolate the future in a parallel fashion. By doing so, the model can capture contextual knowledge lying in a temporal CVS sequence while being regularized to explore a general relationship over the entire time-series. A motion-influenced CVS of low-quality is detected, based on the residual between the input sequence and its neural representation with a cut--off value determined from the two-sigma rule of thumb over the training set. Our experimental observations validated two claims: (i) in the learning environment of label-absence, assessment performance is achievable at a competitive level to the supervised setting, and (ii) the contextual information across a time series of CVS is advantageous for effectively realizing motion-induced unrealistic distortions in signal amplitude and morphology. We also investigated the capability as a pseudo-labeling tool to minimize human-craft annotation by preemptively providing strong candidates for motion-induced anomalies. Empirical evidence has shown that machine-guided annotation can reduce inevitable human-errors during manual assessment while minimizing cumbersome and time-consuming processes.\nImportant links\n\nCMPB 108079\nArXiv: 2305.09368\n\nCitation\n@article{HYUN2024108079,\n  title         = {Unsupervised sequence-to-sequence learning for automatic signal quality assessment in multi-channel electrical impedance-based hemodynamic monitoring},\n  journal       = {Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine},\n  volume        = {247},\n  pages         = {108079},\n  year          = {2024},\n  issn          = {0169-2607},\n  doi           = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108079},\n  url           = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260724000750},\n  author        = {Chang Min Hyun and Tae-Geun Kim and Kyounghun Lee},\n  keywords      = {Cardiopulmonary monitoring, Electrical impedance, Signal quality assessment, Time-series anomaly detection, Unsupervised learning, Recurrent neural network, Variational auto-encoder}\n}\n\n"

This novel approach is specifically designed to address the challenge of analyzing collision events with multiple invisible particles, which are prevalent in many high-energy physics experiments. DeeLeMa is constructed based on the kinematic constraints and symmetry of the event topologies. We show that DeeLeMa can robustly estimate mass distribution even in the presence of combinatorial uncertainties and detector smearing effects. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various event topologies by leveraging the relevant kinematic symmetries. This work opens up exciting opportunities for the analysis of high-energy particle collision data, and we believe that DeeLeMa has the potential to become a valuable tool for the high-energy physics community.\nImportant links\n\nPRR: 5, 043186\nArXiv: 2212.12836\nGitHub\n\nCitation\n@article{Ban:2023mjy,\n    author = &quot;Ban, Kayoung and Kang, Dong Woo and Kim, Tae-Geun and Park, Seong Chan and Park, Yeji&quot;,\n    title = &quot;{Missing information search with deep learning for mass estimation}&quot;,\n    doi = &quot;10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043186&quot;,\n    journal = &quot;Phys.

Once produced, as axions predominantly decay into photons, we may detect the enhanced photon spectrum using sensitive detectors. We introduce a new methodology by defining the time-varying decay process for particles to fly and decay over time on a cosmological scale. This paper provides the estimated photon spectrum and the flux under some simplified assumptions about PBH, 1) monochromatic mass spectrum and 2) isotropic distribution at cosmological scales. Future detectors, such as e-ASTROGAM, have great chances of detecting the signal.\nImportant links\n\nArXiv: 2212.11977\n\nCitation\n@article{Jho:2022wxd,\n    author = &quot;Jho, Yongsoo and Kim, Tae-Geun and Park, Jong-Chul and Park, Seong Chan and Park, Yeji&quot;,\n    title = &quot;{Axions from Primordial Black Holes}&quot;,\n    eprint = &quot;2212.11977&quot;,\n    archivePrefix = &quot;arXiv&quot;,\n    primaryClass = &quot;hep-ph&quot;,\n    month = &quot;12&quot;,\n    year = &quot;2022&quot;\n}\n\n"
